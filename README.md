# Bankist-WebApp
Bankist is a mock-up of a banking web-app created with Javascript. Users can send funds to other accounts, sort through transaction history, request a loan, and logout. All user account names and passwords are stored in the JavaScript file in an object. All CSS, HTML, and photos were written/created by Jonas Schedtmann as part of his Javascript course on Udemy.
